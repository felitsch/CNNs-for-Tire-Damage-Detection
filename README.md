# Tire Damage Detection - Deep Learning Project

## Overview
In this project, we use Deep Learning techniques to identify tire damage from a dataset of tire images. Our team has chosen this problem as an interesting application of Deep Learning in the automotive industry.

## About the Dataset
Context
The dataset consists of 1028 images of tires in total.
